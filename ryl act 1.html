	<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
	<p><bold>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly had been staring out of her window  for about an hour now. on her dsk, lying between copies of
	<i>Nature</i>,<i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other sciemtific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumebed copy of <i>On The Road</i>.
	It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
	<p><bold>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had spentthe last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that 
	"Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, 
	unrevaling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.
